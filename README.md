  <img alt="Citropy running a Claude Code conversation beside the conversation list" src="docs/assets/chat-light.png">
</picture>

Run the coding agents you already use side by side. Each conversation picks its own agent, model, and permission mode, and can switch agents without losing its history. Files, Git, terminals, and the browser are shared by the whole project.

## Install

**Linux and macOS**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinuxongit/Citropy/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows** (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinuxongit/Citropy/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

You need Git and at least one signed-in agent CLI: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), or [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). No Node.js or admin password needed. Citropy updates itself from Settings.

## Features

### Review every change

Changes are grouped into added, changed, and deleted. Stage, unstage, or revert a single hunk, and restore or branch from any earlier message.

### Commit and push

The Git tab above the composer shows the branch and what's waiting to push. AI commit writes the message in a separate session, so your conversation stays clean.

### Code editor

Browse and edit files with the Monaco editor, the one inside VS Code, right beside the conversation.

### Browser and terminals

Agents drive the same browser and terminals you see. The browser has phone and tablet sizes.

### Computer use

Share a screen and the agent can click and type in desktop apps. Pause or stop it anytime. Linux and macOS.

### Questions in one place

When an agent needs a decision, it asks above the composer. Pick one, pick several, or write your own.

### SSH and Docker

Open a folder on another machine or in a container from **Add project**. Agents, Git, and terminals run there. The window stays on yours.
